the frimware now has a working basic framework for taking in serial msg at the following format and executing corresponding command:
[CMD_ID][Parameter*n(determined by CMD_ID)][END_CHAR]

What has been tested is the trigger function that toggles a pin to high and nonblockingly resets after a preset interval. CMD_ID 10 is sent and the MSG_END_CHAR, which is '$' at the moment, and light up the on-board LED for 500ms. This will be useful as the step triggers of stepper driver.

One problem that's encountered is that CR,LF are actual bytes and caused an offset in the index of the CMD_buf for receiving the next byte.
